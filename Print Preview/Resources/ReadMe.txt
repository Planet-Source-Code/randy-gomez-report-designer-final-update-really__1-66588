I was looking for a good print preview module
in the internet for a while, but as happens 
frequently, I didn't find it. Therefore I decided
to write my own routines.
The result is this Print Preview Dll that can be 
embedded in any other project.
Actually it still in a beta face, but was successfully
implkemented in a commercial product.

Features includes font rotation, several zoom ratios,
in place host (see sample), exporting to html, cvs and 
text (I'll work with more other formats if I find is well
received for the programmers community), printed page 
range smart selector, and some other things.

Most of this code was written by myself from scratch, 
when some code is borrowed from other source it is 
indicated.

You are free to use this code in your own projects,
but please, because I worked too hard to write it, 
just add the proper credits in the about box of your 
product.
I you have any improvement or idea for the component
let me know and I'll try to incorporate it.
Thanks.
