### Description

UPDATE 11/07/2006 - Now has TEST GROUP for easier testing without compile. Added 'Start New Page' option to group headers, fixed various bugs with opening saved files, further fixes to undo.

UPDATE 10/26/2006 - Mainly fixed up Undo (removed Redo) plus other minor bug fixes

UPDATE 10/19/2006 - Further improvements to GUI, coolbar control, better icons

UPDATED 10/12/2006 - Group Headers/Footers, new selection modes, bug fixes, etc.

This is a project I WAS working on for a long while but never did complete. I'm uploading it mainly for the interface example that may be of help to others. You can create and preview simple reports. *** IMPORTANT *** Please read the Readme.doc before using this program.
 
### More Info
 
PLEASE NOTE : This application requires the Ramosoft print preview dll. I have included the source for it, which must be compile and referenced in this project in order to use the print preview. I have made some modifications to the original print preview code.
